# Letterboxinator

Letterboxinator is a program that can change the ratio of an image without cropping it. It can fill the resulting empty space in three ways; using a blurred version of the origional image, using a specified color, or by repeating the edge pixels. All this is easily done through a graphical user interface, where you just drag and drop your image, and a letterboxed version of the image is placed in the same folder.

## Examples
Note that all the examples here showcase a ratio of 16x9. The program can handle any ratio, including vertical ones, but 16x9 is the most common use case.
